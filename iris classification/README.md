# Iris Classification Project

This project develops a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers based on their features using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Structure

- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full project code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
- `iris_model.h5`: Saved neural network model.
- `images/`: Folder containing images used in the README (optional).

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
